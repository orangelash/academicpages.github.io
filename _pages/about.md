Hi, my name is João Amaral, know online as Orangelash, and I'm a Portuguese Informatics Engineering student, currently working torwards my masters degree at Universidade da Beira Interior in Covilhã, Portugal.

My studies focus mainly in *Artificial Inteligence*, *Secure Software*, *Cloud Computing* and  *Parallel and Distributed Computing*. I'm also very interested in Game Development.

I am always interested to engage in interesting projects and to work with motivated people, so if you think we can work together, drop me an email.
